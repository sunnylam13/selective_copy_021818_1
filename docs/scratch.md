# Scratch File

We're going to just automatically create the new folder with the copied files in the cwd or "current working directory".

It would be possible in the future to write the program to output to a user specified directory.

Or we could make it default to the master level parent like `C:\\` or `/` or the user's main parent (`~/`).

In the case of using any destination directory we should print the name of the directory it will be stored in at the end of the program.
