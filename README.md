# Selective File Copy

The program walks through a folder tree and seeks files with certain file extensions (i.e. pdf, jpg).  It then copies these files from where they are in to a new folder.

## Test Data

The test data is found in:

	/Users/sunnyair/Dropbox/python_projects/selective_copy_021818_1/docs/testFolder

The file path to use is:

	../docs/testFolder

the use of "." means within execution file's cwd...  ".." means one level above it in the project directory...

The file extension to test with is:

	.txt
